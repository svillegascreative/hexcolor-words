When submitting a PR:
- Please read and follow the [rules](https://github.com/svillegascreative/hexcolor-words/blob/main/RULES.md) for word inclusion in the list
- Hex code, name, and URL are all required
- Hex codes should start with # and be written in uppercase
- Names should be written in uppercase
- Words should be placed in alphabetical order by name in `colors.json`

## Rule suggestions

The [word rules](https://github.com/svillegascreative/hexcolor-words/blob/main/RULES.md) were kept simple to get this project started and keep it small. Many expansions are possible, but these might bring a need for additional features. Suggestions are welcome [for discussion](https://github.com/svillegascreative/hexcolor-words/discussions).
