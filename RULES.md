# Rules for word inclusion

The initial word set follows the rules below, which helped keep the app simple. Rules are subject to change if the app changes or grows, but right now it's just a fun little side project, so inclusion is just based on my discretion!

## Letters

Letters A-F represent themselves, of course.

To keep things simple, numerical digits are restricted to only a few alphabetical interpretations, as follows:

| digit | letter interpretation   |
|-------|-------------------------|
| `0`   | O (*Oscar*)             |
| `1`   | I (*India*) __or__ L (*Lima*), but __never both__ within one word |
| `2`   | Z                       |
| `5`   | S                       |
| `6`   | G                       |
| `7`   | T                       |
| `8`   | "ate" (or homonym)      |

> `1` gets two interpretations, because one works well in lowercase (e.g. `#b0bb1e`/'bobble') and one in uppercase (e.g. `#B0BB1E`/'bobbie')

> `2` may be changed from 'Z' to 'R' if that makes more sense and there is enough support. Currently there are no words with 'Z', but it is arguably closer to `2` than 'R' is.

> `3` and `4` are excluded because they represent 'E' and 'A', which are already available as letters.

## General

- English words only.
- Currently only 6-letter words are included. 3-letter and 8-letter options may be considered in the future.
- Plurals are allowed (e.g. `#CADE75`/'cadets')
- Any verb form is allowed (e.g. `#F10A7S`/'floats' or `#DABBED`/'dabbed')
- Letters cannot be duplicated just for fun or convenience (e.g. `#DECAFF` doesn't count, because 'decaffeinated' shortens to 'decaf')
- Words must have a valid URL to legitimize them. Dictionary sites are best (Merriam-Webster preferred).
- Alternate interpretations are allowed if the use of `1` changes the word (e.g. `#B0BB1E` can be either 'bobble' or 'bobbie'), but both uses of `1` cannot be used in the same word.
- Currently, no proper names, place names, brands, or products are included.

## Suggestions

If there is interest in including more words and/or adding the features to support them, these rules can be amended. Feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/svillegascreative/hexcolor-words/discussions).
